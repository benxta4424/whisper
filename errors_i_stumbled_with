1. Turbo frame tag wasn't working:
fix:should not use both javascript_importmap_tags and javascript_include_tag. The javascript_importmap_tags helper already handles loading JavaScript , so adding javascript_include_tag is redundant and can cause conflicts.

2. Lazy loading turbo frame
i tried:rendering lazy turbo frames so the current user can add posts/comments in real time without page reload (SPA)
issues:i didnt understand how the frames really work and tried to render it directly which requires a page reload and without using turbo_stream
fix:i render the partial that contains the form into an available route (such as NEW/CREATE) and i use the turbo frame tag to name the form and render it into the wanted container with turbo_Streams which does the job without needing a reload (for the current user at least)

I used click on a submit which rendered the form useless as the action of the submit form has been changed to that of the stimulus controller that acted upon the click.
fix:i stumbled upon an old post that had the same problem as me: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70732712/reset-form-in-hotwire. And used it to clear the comments input field and posts input field
